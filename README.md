This is an imageboard written with Phoenix. It's not really on par with existing imageboard engines and i certainly don't expect anybody to use it, but I wanted to learn phoenix and like imageboards so it seemed like a cool project. I also tried to minimize the amount of JS used, because I have an aversion to it.

Hope anyone else who sees this enjoys.

## Setup

This is designed to be run with nix (since thats what i'm developing on). It should be sufficient to start up a nix shell with the provided config and then run [setup.sh](/setup.sh) and start the phoenix server
