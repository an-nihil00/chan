# (Slime)Chan

This is an imageboard (eventually) written in with Phoenix. As it is now, its a mostly functional anonymous textboard.

## Why?

Because I wanted to learn phoenix and and also every imageboard engine seems to be written in php, which I hate.

## Setup

This is designed to be run with nix (since thats what i'm developing on). It should be sufficient to start up a nix shell with the provided config and then run [setup.sh](/setup.sh) and start the phoenix server
